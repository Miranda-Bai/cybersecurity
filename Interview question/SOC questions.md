# SOC (blue team) interview questions

## Scenario-based Interview Questions

### 1. How can we triage alerts escalated from the SOC and differentiate false positives from genuine security threats?

To perform triage on SOC alerts, first prioritize them based on severity, source credibility, and the potential impact on the organization. Analyze the alert context within the network environment and compare it against 
known attack patterns and behaviors. To differentiate false positives, utilize historical data, adjust correlation rules in the SIEM, and apply threat intelligence feeds to validate the alerts. This process helps reduce false positives and focuses on genuine threats.

### 2. Can you describe your experience with SIEM tools like Sentinel, ArcSight, and Splunk? How have you used these tools for monitoring and incident response?

Talking about my experience with Sentinel, ArcSight, and Splunk, I have used them for real-time monitoring, log management, and incident investigation. For example, I've developed custom dashboards with Splunk to visualize threat data and created alerts for anomalous activities based on specific thresholds. These tools have been instrumental in my ability to quickly identify, investigate, and respond to security incidents by providing a comprehensive view of the security posture and enabling efficient data analysis.

### 3. How can the MITRE ATT&CK framework be utilized in threat-hunting and incident response activities?

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a cornerstone of threat-hunting and incident-response strategies. It maps out adversary tactics and techniques observed in alerts or during investigations, allowing us to understand the attacker's objectives and anticipate their next steps. 
Threat hunting references the framework to design queries and hypotheses likely to uncover stealthy, malicious activities. During incident response, it guides the analysis and helps develop effective containment and remediation strategies.

### 4. Explain how to use technologies like MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint), CB (Carbon Black), Azure, and CrowdStrike in security operations.

Talking about MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint ) is used to implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) strategies to identify threats at the endpoint level. Carbon Black has been crucial for real-time monitoring and preventive controls. In Azure environments, it leveraged the security center for improved cloud security posture 
management. CrowdStrike, on the other hand, provided advanced threat-hunting capabilities. Each tool has its strengths and collectively enhances the organization's security framework.

### 5. Discuss your approach to documentation, including creating handover notes, playbooks, minutes of meetings (MOM), and trackers.

Documentation is key to efficient and effective security operations. For handover notes, ensure all critical information about ongoing incidents or alerts is summarized for the next shift. Playbooks are developed based on best practices and tailored to specific incident types to guide 
the response process. Minutes of meetings are meticulously recorded to capture decisions and action items. Trackers monitor the progress of investigations, responses, and remediation efforts. This structured approach to documentation ensures continuity and accountability within the SOC team.

### 6. How do you stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and trends, and how does this knowledge impact your work in the SOC?

Cybersecurity encompasses a wide range of areas, requiring a constant update on the latest trends and threats. Engaging with various channels, such as news outlets dedicated to cybersecurity, online forums, threat intelligence feeds, and professional networks, is crucial to stay informed. Participating in webinars, training sessions, and conferences is vital in this ongoing learning process. This commitment to continuous education allows for anticipating emerging threats and incorporating the latest best practices in Security Operations Center (SOC)procedures. By keeping abreast of developments, you can enhance monitoring and response strategies, adopting a proactive stance that significantly strengthens your defensive capabilities rather than a reactive one.

### 7. Can you explain a complex security incident you managed? How did you identify it and respond, and what was the outcome?

In my previous organization, a notable incident involved a sophisticated spear-phishing attack targeting senior executives. I identified the attack by correlating unusual outbound traffic with email logs, which revealed malicious attachments. Utilizing the incident response playbook, I quickly isolated affected systems and began containment procedures. We conducted a thorough investigation, identifying the attack vector and implementing additional email security measures to prevent recurrence. The successful incident containment with no significant data breach highlighted the importance of rapid response and effective communication within the SOC team.
